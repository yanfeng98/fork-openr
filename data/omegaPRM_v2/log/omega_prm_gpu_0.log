2025-01-09 11:44:29,368 [INFO] Skipping question: A board game spinner is divided into three parts labeled $A$, $B$  and $C$. The probability of the spinner landing on $A$ is $\frac{1}{3}$ and the probability of the spinner landing on $B$ is $\frac{5}{12}$.  What is the probability of the spinner landing on $C$? Express your answer as a common fraction.

2025-01-09 11:47:03,133 [INFO] Skipping question: How many 4-letter words with at least one consonant can be constructed from the letters $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, and $E$?  (Note that $B$, $C$, and $D$ are consonants, any word is valid, not just English language words, and letters may be used more than once.)
2025-01-09 11:47:14,779 [INFO] Question passed filter: Melinda will roll two standard six-sided dice and make a two-digit number with the two numbers she rolls. For example, if she rolls a 6 and a 3, she can either form 36 or 63. What is the probability that she will be able to make an integer between 10 and 20, inclusive? Express your answer as a common fraction.

2025-01-09 11:49:11,421 [INFO] Question passed filter: Let $p$ be the probability that, in the process of repeatedly flipping a fair coin, one will encounter a run of $5$ heads before one encounters a run of $2$ tails. Given that $p$ can be written in the form $m/n$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers, find $m+n$.

Each plate contains a sequence of five characters chosen from the four letters in AIME and the four digits in 2007. No character may appear in a sequence more times than it appears among the four letters in AIME or the four digits in 2007. A set of plates in which each possible sequence appears exactly once contains $N$ license plates. Find $\frac{N}{10}$.
