Since \\(3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}\\), the sum \\(3 + p + q + r\\) will be divisible by three if and only if \\(p + q + r \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}\\).

The formula for combinations is:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{10}{5} = \\frac{10!}{5!5!}\n\\]\n\nCalculating the factorials, we get:\n\n\\[\n10! = 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 3628800\n\\]\n\\[\n5! = 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 120\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\binom{10}{5} = \\frac{3628800}{120 \\times 120} = \\frac{3628800}{14400} = 252\n\\]\n\nThis gives us the number of ways to choose 5 distinct numbers from 10. However, since the order of the numbers in the column matters, we need to consider all permutations of these 5 numbers. The number of permutations of 5 distinct numbers is given by \\(5!\\):\n\n\\[\n5! = 120\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of distinct possibilities for the values in the first column is the product of the number of ways to choose the 5 numbers and the number of ways to arrange them:\n\n\\[\n252 \\times 120 = 30240\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of distinct possibilities for the values in the first column of a SHORT BINGO card is \\(\\boxed{30240}\\). \n\n\n\n\n", "label": ["+", "+", "+"]}, {"question": "In SHORT BINGO, a $5\\times5$ card is filled by marking the middle square as WILD and placing 24 other numbers in the remaining 24 squares.\n\n\nSpecifically a card is made by placing 5 distinct numbers from the set $1-10$ in the first column, 5 distinct numbers from $11-20$ in the second column, 4 distinct numbers $21-30$ in the third column (skipping the WILD square in the middle), 5 distinct numbers from $31-40$ in the fourth column and 5 distinct numbers from $41-50$ in the last column.\n\nOne possible SHORT BINGO card is:\n\n[asy]\nfor (int i=0; i<6;++i) {\ndraw((i,0)--(i,5));\ndraw((0,i)--(5,i));\n}\nlabel(\"$1$\",(.5,0.5));\nlabel(\"$2$\",(.5,1.5));\nlabel(\"$3$\",(.5,2.5));\nlabel(\"$4$\",(.5,3.5));\nlabel(\"$5$\",(.5,4.5));\n\nlabel(\"$20$\",(1.5,0.5));\nlabel(\"$19$\",(1.5,1.5));\nlabel(\"$18$\",(1.5,2.5));\nlabel(\"$17$\",(1.5,3.5));\nlabel(\"$16$\",(1.5,4.5));\n\nlabel(\"$21$\",(2.5,0.5));\nlabel(\"$22$\",(2.5,1.5));\nlabel(\"Wild\",(2.5,2.5));\nlabel(\"$24$\",(2.5,3.5));\nlabel(\"$25$\",(2.5,4.5));\n\nlabel(\"$40$\",(3.5,0.5));\nlabel(\"$39$\",(3.5,1.5));\nlabel(\"$38$\",(3.5,2.5));\nlabel(\"$37$\",(3.5,3.5));\nlabel(\"$36$\",(3.5,4.5));\n\nlabel(\"$41$\",(4.5,0.5));\nlabel(\"$42$\",(4.5,1.5));\nlabel(\"$43$\",(4.5,2.5));\nlabel(\"$44$\",(4.5,3.5));\nlabel(\"$45$\",(4.5,4.5));\n\n[/asy]\n\nTo play SHORT BINGO, someone names numbers, chosen at random, and players mark those numbers on their cards.

The formula for combinations is:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{10}{5} = \\frac{10!}{5!5!}\n\\]\n\nCalculating the factorials, we get:\n\n\\[\n10! = 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 3628800\n\\]\n\\[\n5! = 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 120\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\binom{10}{5} = \\frac{3628800}{120 \\times 120} = \\frac{3628800}{14400} = 252\n\\]\n\nOnce we have chosen the 5 numbers, we need to arrange them in the 5 positions in the first column. The number of ways to arrange 5 distinct numbers in 5 positions is given by the permutation formula \\(5!\\), which is:\n\n\\[\n5! = 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 120\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of distinct possibilities for the values in the first column is the product of the number of ways to choose the 5 numbers and the number of ways to arrange them:\n\n\\[\n252 \\times 120 = 30240\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of distinct possibilities for the values in the first column of a SHORT BINGO card is \\(\\boxed{30240}\\). \n\n\n\n\n", "label": ["+", "+", "+"]}, {"question": "In SHORT BINGO, a $5\\times5$ card is filled by marking the middle square as WILD and placing 24 other numbers in the remaining 24 squares.\n\n\nSpecifically a card is made by placing 5 distinct numbers from the set $1-10$ in the first column, 5 distinct numbers from $11-20$ in the second column, 4 distinct numbers $21-30$ in the third column (skipping the WILD square in the middle), 5 distinct numbers from $31-40$ in the fourth column and 5 distinct numbers from $41-50$ in the last column.\n\nOne possible SHORT BINGO card is:\n\n[asy]\nfor (int i=0; i<6;++i) {\ndraw((i,0)--(i,5));\ndraw((0,i)--(5,i));\n}\nlabel(\"$1$\",(.5,0.5));\nlabel(\"$2$\",(.5,1.5));\nlabel(\"$3$\",(.5,2.5));\nlabel(\"$4$\",(.5,3.5));\nlabel(\"$5$\",(.5,4.5));\n\nlabel(\"$20$\",(1.5,0.5));\nlabel(\"$19$\",(1.5,1.5));\nlabel(\"$18$\",(1.5,2.5));\nlabel(\"$17$\",(1.5,3.5));\nlabel(\"$16$\",(1.5,4.5));\n\nlabel(\"$21$\",(2.5,0.5));\nlabel(\"$22$\",(2.5,1.5));\nlabel(\"Wild\",(2.5,2.5));\nlabel(\"$24$\",(2.5,3.5));\nlabel(\"$25$\",(2.5,4.5));\n\nlabel(\"$40$\",(3.5,0.5));\nlabel(\"$39$\",(3.5,1.5));\nlabel(\"$38$\",(3.5,2.5));\nlabel(\"$37$\",(3.5,3.5));\nlabel(\"$36$\",(3.5,4.5));\n\nlabel(\"$41$\",(4.5,0.5));\nlabel(\"$42$\",(4.5,1.5));\nlabel(\"$43$\",(4.5,2.5));\nlabel(\"$44$\",(4.5,3.5));\nlabel(\"$45$\",(4.5,4.5));\n\n[/asy]\n\nTo play SHORT BINGO, someone names numbers, chosen at random, and players mark those numbers on their cards.

The formula for combinations is:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{10}{5} = \\frac{10!}{5! \\cdot (10-5)!} = \\frac{10!}{5! \\cdot 5!}\n\\]\n\nCalculating the factorials, we get:\n\n\\[\n10! = 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 3628800\n\\]\n\\[\n5! = 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 120\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\binom{10}{5} = \\frac{3628800}{120 \\times 120} = \\frac{3628800}{14400} = 252\n\\]\n\nThis gives us the number of ways to choose 5 distinct numbers from the set of 10. However, since the order of the numbers in the column matters, we need to consider all permutations of these 5 numbers. The number of permutations of 5 distinct numbers is given by \\(5!\\):\n\n\\[\n5! = 120\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of distinct possibilities for the values in the first column is the product of the number of ways to choose the 5 numbers and the number of ways to arrange them:\n\n\\[\n252 \\times 120 = 30240\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of distinct possibilities for the values in the first column of a SHORT BINGO card is \\(\\boxed{30240}\\). \n\n\n\n\n", "label": ["+", "+", "+"]}, {"question": "In SHORT BINGO, a $5\\times5$ card is filled by marking the middle square as WILD and placing 24 other numbers in the remaining 24 squares.\n\n\nSpecifically a card is made by placing 5 distinct numbers from the set $1-10$ in the first column, 5 distinct numbers from $11-20$ in the second column, 4 distinct numbers $21-30$ in the third column (skipping the WILD square in the middle), 5 distinct numbers from $31-40$ in the fourth column and 5 distinct numbers from $41-50$ in the last column.\n\nOne possible SHORT BINGO card is:\n\n[asy]\nfor (int i=0; i<6;++i) {\ndraw((i,0)--(i,5));\ndraw((0,i)--(5,i));\n}\nlabel(\"$1$\",(.5,0.5));\nlabel(\"$2$\",(.5,1.5));\nlabel(\"$3$\",(.5,2.5));\nlabel(\"$4$\",(.5,3.5));\nlabel(\"$5$\",(.5,4.5));\n\nlabel(\"$20$\",(1.5,0.5));\nlabel(\"$19$\",(1.5,1.5));\nlabel(\"$18$\",(1.5,2.5));\nlabel(\"$17$\",(1.5,3.5));\nlabel(\"$16$\",(1.5,4.5));\n\nlabel(\"$21$\",(2.5,0.5));\nlabel(\"$22$\",(2.5,1.5));\nlabel(\"Wild\",(2.5,2.5));\nlabel(\"$24$\",(2.5,3.5));\nlabel(\"$25$\",(2.5,4.5));\n\nlabel(\"$40$\",(3.5,0.5));\nlabel(\"$39$\",(3.5,1.5));\nlabel(\"$38$\",(3.5,2.5));\nlabel(\"$37$\",(3.5,3.5));\nlabel(\"$36$\",(3.5,4.5));\n\nlabel(\"$41$\",(4.5,0.5));\nlabel(\"$42$\",(4.5,1.5));\nlabel(\"$43$\",(4.5,2.5));\nlabel(\"$44$\",(4.5,3.5));\nlabel(\"$45$\",(4.5,4.5));\n\n[/asy]\n\nTo play SHORT BINGO, someone names numbers, chosen at random, and players mark those numbers on their cards.

This means that the remaining \\( 107 - x \\) students score at most the mean. For the mean to be calculated, there must be at least one student who scores at most the mean, otherwise, the mean would be undefined (if all students scored above the mean) or the mean would be greater than all scores (which is not possible).\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible value for \\( 107 - x \\) is 1, which means \\( x \\) can be at most \\( 107 - 1 = 106 \\).\n\nTo confirm, let's consider the scenario where 106 students score above the mean and 1 student scores at most the mean.

This confirms that the mean calculated will indeed be greater than the score of the student who scored at most the mean, and all 106 students who scored above the mean will be awarded extra credit.\n\nThus, the largest number of students who can be awarded extra credit is \\(\\boxed{106}\\). \n\n\n\n\n", "label": ["-", "-", "+"]}, {"question": "Mr. Mendez awards extra credit on quizzes to his students with quiz grades that exceed the class mean.

Each package contains one of each digit from 0 through 9, so we will divide the total count of each digit by 10 and round up to the nearest whole number to find out how many packages are required.\n\nFirst, let's count the digits in the range 100 to 125:\n\n- **Hundreds place**: All numbers have a 1 in the hundreds place.

The figure consists of a hexagon with an additional triangle extending from it. The vertices of the hexagon are labeled as follows:\n\n- \\( A_0 = (0, 0) \\)\n- \\( A_1 = (1, 0) \\)\n- \\( A_2 = (2, 0) \\)\n- \\( A_3 = (1, 1) \\)\n- \\( A_4 = (0, 1) \\)\n- \\( A_5 = (-1, 1) \\)\n\nThe additional triangle has vertices \\( A_1, A_3, \\) and \\( A_4 \\).\n\n### Step 1: Count the triangles within the hexagon\n\nWe will count the triangles formed by choosing 3 vertices from the 6 vertices of the hexagon. The number of ways to choose 3 vertices out of 6 is given by the combination formula \\( \\binom{6}{3} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6!}{3!(6-3)!} = \\frac{6 \\times 5 \\times 4}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 20\n\\]\n\nHowever, not all of these combinations form valid triangles within the hexagon.

The additional triangle has vertices \\( A_1, A_3, \\) and \\( A_4 \\).\n\n- **Triangles with \\( A_1 \\) as a vertex:**\n  - \\( (A_1, A_3, A_4) \\) (already counted)\n  - \\( (A_1, A_2, A_3) \\)\n  - \\( (A_1, A_3, A_5) \\)\n  - \\( (A_1, A_4, A_5) \\)\n\n- **Triangles with \\( A_3 \\) as a vertex:**\n  - \\( (A_1, A_3, A_4) \\) (already counted)\n  - \\( (A_2, A_3, A_4) \\)\n  - \\( (A_3, A_4, A_5) \\)\n\n- **Triangles with \\( A_4 \\) as a vertex:**\n  - \\( (A_1, A_3, A_4) \\) (already counted)\n  - \\( (A_1, A_4, A_5) \\)\n  - \\( (A_2, A_4, A_5) \\)\n\nFrom the above, we see that there are new triangles formed with each vertex of the additional triangle:\n- \\( (A_1, A_2, A_3) \\)\n- \\( (A_1, A_3, A_5) \\)\n- \\( (A_1, A_4, A_5) \\)\n- \\( (A_2, A_3, A_4) \\)\n- \\( (A_3, A_4, A_5) \\)\n- \\( (A_1, A_4, A_5) \\) (already counted)\n\nThus, there are \\( 6 \\) new triangles involving the additional triangle.\n\n### Step 3: Add the triangles\n\nFinally, we add the number of triangles within the hexagon to the number of triangles involving the additional triangle:\n\n\\[\n16 + 6 = 22\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of triangles in the figure is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{22}\n\\] \n\n\n\n\n", "label": ["-", "+"]}, {"question": "How many triangles are in the figure to the right?

By examining the given lattice, we can see that there are 6 such triangles:\n- One triangle with vertices at \\((0,0)\\), \\((1,0)\\), and \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)\\).\n- One triangle with vertices at \\((1,0)\\), \\((2,0)\\), and \\(\\left(\\frac{3}{2}, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)\\).\n- One triangle with vertices at \\((2,0)\\), \\((1.5, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})\\), and \\((1, \\sqrt{3})\\).\n- One triangle with vertices at \\((1.5, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})\\), \\((1, \\sqrt{3})\\), and \\((0.5, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})\\).\n- One triangle with vertices at \\((1, \\sqrt{3})\\), \\((0.5, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})\\), and \\((-0.5, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})\\).\n- One triangle with vertices at \\((0.5, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})\\), \\((-0.5, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})\\), and \\((0,0)\\).\n\nSo, there are 6 equilateral triangles with side length 1 unit.\n\n**Case 2: Side length = 2 units**\nIn a hexagonal lattice, equilateral triangles with side length 2 units can be formed by connecting every second point in a straight line and then connecting the endpoints to the point in the middle of the line segment. By examining the given lattice, we can see that there are 2 such triangles:\n- One triangle with vertices at \\((0,0)\\), \\((2,0)\\), and \\((1, \\sqrt{3})\\).\n- One triangle with vertices at \\((2,0)\\), \\((4,0)\\), and \\((3, \\sqrt{3})\\).\n\nSo, there are 2 equilateral triangles with side length 2 units.\n\n**Case 3: Side length > 2 units**\nIn a hexagonal lattice, it is not possible to form equilateral triangles with side length greater than 2 units using only the points in the given lattice.

We will check if there are any larger equilateral triangles with side lengths that are multiples of this unit.\n\n### Step 2: Count the equilateral triangles with side length 1 unit\nWe start by counting the smallest equilateral triangles. Each point in the lattice has six neighbors, and each pair of neighbors forms an equilateral triangle. However, we must avoid double-counting.\n\nConsider the hexagonal lattice as follows:\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{ccccccc}\n & & & \\cdot & & & \\\\\n & & \\cdot & & \\cdot & & \\\\\n & \\cdot & & \\cdot & & \\cdot & \\\\\n\\cdot & & \\cdot & \\cdot & \\cdot & & \\cdot \\\\\n & \\cdot & & \\cdot & & \\cdot & \\\\\n & & \\cdot & & \\cdot & & \\\\\n & & & \\cdot & & & \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nEach point is connected to its six neighbors, forming 6 equilateral triangles per point. However, each triangle is shared by three points. Therefore, the total number of equilateral triangles with side length 1 unit is:\n\\[\n\\frac{7 \\times 6}{3} = 14\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Count the equilateral triangles with side length 2 units\nNext, we look for equilateral triangles with side length 2 units. These triangles are formed by connecting points that are two units apart.\n\nConsider the following pattern:\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{ccccccc}\n & & & \\cdot & & & \\\\\n & & \\cdot & & \\cdot & & \\\\\n & \\cdot & & \\cdot & & \\cdot & \\\\\n\\cdot & & \\cdot & \\cdot & \\cdot & & \\cdot \\\\\n & \\cdot & & \\cdot & & \\cdot & \\\\\n & & \\cdot & & \\cdot & & \\\\\n & & & \\cdot & & & \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nEach pair of points two units apart forms an equilateral triangle. We can count these triangles by considering the rows and columns.\n\n- In the middle row, there are 5 pairs of points two units apart.\n- In the top and bottom rows, there are 3 pairs of points two units apart.\n\nThus, the total number of equilateral triangles with side length 2 units is:\n\\[\n5 + 3 = 8\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Count the equilateral triangles with side length 3 units\nFinally, we look for equilateral triangles with side length 3 units. These triangles are formed by connecting points that are three units apart.\n\nConsider the following pattern:\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{ccccccc}\n & & & \\cdot & & & \\\\\n & & \\cdot & & \\cdot & & \\\\\n & \\cdot & & \\cdot & & \\cdot & \\\\\n\\cdot & & \\cdot & \\cdot & \\cdot & & \\cdot \\\\\n & \\cdot & & \\cdot & & \\cdot & \\\\\n & & \\cdot & & \\cdot & & \\\\\n & & & \\cdot & & & \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n- In the middle row, there is 1 pair of points three units apart.\n- There are no pairs of points three units apart in the top and bottom rows.\n\nThus, the total number of equilateral triangles with side length 3 units is:\n\\[\n1\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Sum the total number of equilateral triangles\nAdding up the equilateral triangles of all side lengths, we get:\n\\[\n14 + 8 + 1 = 23\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of equilateral triangles with all three vertices in the lattice is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{23}\n\\] \n\n\n\n\n", "label": ["-", "+"]}, {"question": "Each point in the hexagonal lattice shown is one unit from its nearest neighbor.

Let's count these triangles:\n- There are 6 triangles formed by the points at the vertices of the outer hexagon.\n- There are no other triangles of side length 1 unit within the lattice.\n\nSo, there are \\(6\\) equilateral triangles of side length 1 unit.\n\n### Step 3: Count Equilateral Triangles of Side Length 2 Units\nAn equilateral triangle with a side length of 2 units can be formed by connecting every second point in the lattice.

Each point in the hexagonal lattice is one unit from its nearest neighbors, and the lattice can be visualized as a series of intersecting equilateral triangles. \n\n\n\n\n Let's consider the possible side lengths of the equilateral triangles that can be formed.\n\n### Case 1: Side length = 1\nFor side length 1, the equilateral triangles are the smallest triangles in the lattice. Each point in the lattice is a vertex of such a triangle. We can count the number of these triangles by considering the arrangement of the points. The lattice consists of a central point surrounded by six other points, forming a hexagon. Each side of the hexagon is one unit long, and there are six such sides. Additionally, there are six equilateral triangles formed by connecting the central point to each pair of adjacent points on the hexagon. Therefore, there are a total of 6 + 6 = 12 equilateral triangles of side length 1.\n\n### Case 2: Side length = 2\nFor side length 2, the equilateral triangles are formed by connecting points that are two units apart. We can find these triangles by considering the structure of the lattice. Each point in the lattice is the vertex of an equilateral triangle with side length 2 that includes the point and two points two units away from it in a straight line. By examining the lattice, we can see that there are 6 such triangles. These triangles are formed by connecting the central point to the points two units away in the directions of the six sides of the hexagon, and by connecting pairs of points two units apart on the hexagon.\n\n### Case 3: Side length > 2\nFor side lengths greater than 2, we need to check if it is possible to form equilateral triangles with vertices in the lattice. By examining the structure of the lattice, we can see that it is not possible to form equilateral triangles with side lengths greater than 2 using only the points in the given lattice. This is because the distance between any two points in the lattice is either 1 or the distance between two points that form an equilateral triangle with side length 2.\n\n### Conclusion\nAdding up the number of equilateral triangles from each case, we get:\n- 12 triangles of side length 1\n- 6 triangles of side length 2\n\nTherefore, the total number of equilateral triangles with all three vertices in the lattice is:\n\\[\n12 + 6 = 18\n\\]\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{18}\n\\] \n\n\n\n\n", "label": ["-", "-", "+"]}, {"question": "Each point in the hexagonal lattice shown is one unit from its nearest neighbor.

We will check if there are any larger equilateral triangles with side lengths of 2 units or more.\n\n### Step 2: Count the equilateral triangles with side length 1 unit\nIn the given hexagonal lattice, each point is connected to its six nearest neighbors, forming equilateral triangles with side length 1 unit. Let's count these triangles:\n\n- Each point in the center of the hexagon is part of 6 equilateral triangles.\n- Each point on the perimeter of the hexagon is part of 2 equilateral triangles.\n\nSince there are 7 points in the lattice (1 center point and 6 perimeter points), we calculate the total number of equilateral triangles with side length 1 unit:\n\\[\n6 \\text{ (center point)} + 6 \\times 2 \\text{ (perimeter points)} = 6 + 12 = 18\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Check for equilateral triangles with side length 2 units\nTo form an equilateral triangle with side length 2 units, we need to check if there are any sets of three points in the lattice such that each pair of points is 2 units apart.\n\n- Consider the center point and any two adjacent perimeter points. The distance between the center point and each perimeter point is 1 unit, not 2 units.\n- Consider any two adjacent perimeter points. The distance between two adjacent perimeter points is 1 unit, not 2 units.\n- Consider any two perimeter points that are not adjacent but are separated by one other perimeter point. The distance between these two perimeter points is 2 units.\n\nIn the hexagonal lattice, each perimeter point is connected to two other perimeter points that are 2 units away. Since there are 6 perimeter points, we can form:\n\\[\n\\frac{6 \\times 2}{2} = 6\n\\]\nequilateral triangles with side length 2 units.\n\n### Step 4: Check for equilateral triangles with side length 3 units or more\nTo form an equilateral triangle with side length 3 units or more, we need to check if there are any sets of three points in the lattice such that each pair of points is 3 units apart or more. However, in a hexagonal lattice where each point is 1 unit from its nearest neighbor, it is impossible to find such sets of points.\n\n### Step 5: Sum the total number of equilateral triangles\nAdding up the equilateral triangles with side lengths 1 unit and 2 units, we get:\n\\[\n18 + 6 = 24\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of equilateral triangles that have all three vertices in the lattice is \\(\\boxed{24}\\). \n\n\n\n\n", "label": ["-", "+"]}, {"question": "Each point in the hexagonal lattice shown is one unit from its nearest neighbor.

The width is the sum of the side lengths of the squares along the bottom edge. We know that the shaded square has a side length of 1 inch, and there are two other squares to the right of it. Let's denote the side length of each of these squares as \\( s_2 \\) and \\( s_3 \\).\n\nSince the squares are non-overlapping and they form the width of the rectangle, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Width of } ABCD = s_1 + s_2 + s_3\n\\]\n\nGiven that \\( s_1 = 1 \\), we need to determine \\( s_2 \\) and \\( s_3 \\). From the diagram, we observe that \\( s_2 \\) and \\( s_3 \\) are each equal to the side length of the shaded square, which is 1 inch. Therefore:\n\n\\[\ns_2 = 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad s_3 = 1\n\\]\n\nThus, the width of rectangle \\(ABCD\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Width of } ABCD = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 \\text{ inches}\n\\]\n\nFinally, we calculate the area of rectangle \\(ABCD\\) by multiplying its height by its width:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area of } ABCD = \\text{Height} \\times \\text{Width} = 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\text{ square inches}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the area of rectangle \\(ABCD\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{6}\n\\] \n\n\n\n\n", "label": ["+", "+", "+"]}, {"question": "The figure shows three squares with non-overlapping interiors.

Since the area of a square is the side length squared, we have:\n   \\[\n   s^2 = 1 \\implies s = 1\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the side length of the shaded square is 1 inch.\n\n2. **Determine the side lengths of the other squares:**\n   From the diagram, we observe that the shaded square is part of a larger configuration of three squares. Let's denote the side length of the shaded square as \\(s_1 = 1\\). The other two squares are adjacent to the shaded square and each other.\n\n   - The square to the right of the shaded square has a side length equal to the side length of the shaded square plus the side length of the square above it. Since the shaded square is the smallest and we are dealing with non-overlapping squares, the side length of the square to the right is \\(s_2 = 2\\).\n   - The square above the shaded square has a side length equal to the side length of the shaded square, which is \\(s_3 = 1\\).\n\n3. **Calculate the dimensions of rectangle \\(ABCD\\):**\n   - The width of rectangle \\(ABCD\\) is the sum of the side lengths of the squares along the bottom row. This is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Width} = s_1 + s_2 = 1 + 2 = 3 \\text{ inches}\n     \\]\n   - The height of rectangle \\(ABCD\\) is the sum of the side lengths of the squares along the left column.
